FSharpLogisticRegression
========================

At the end it plots the randomly generated testset with the decision boundary that was learned before.

Build Instructions
------------------

Open the solution, compile, start! Easy as this.
You'll probably need Visual Studio 2013 and .Net4.5, you can also run this on Mono. 

Note: this contains a self-patched version of the FSharp.Charting library in order to display a Window.
